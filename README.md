## Discord Bot Installation

See https://github.com/shayaantx/botdarr/wiki/Install-Discord-Bot

## Slack Bot Installation

See https://github.com/shayaantx/botdarr/wiki/Install-Slack-Bot

<b>(WARNING)</b> If you are using slack "/help" has been deprecated by slack, so pick a different prefix for your commands (i.e., command-prefix=$). Otherwise help commands won't work

## Telegram bot installation

See https://github.com/shayaantx/botdarr/wiki/Install-Telegram-Bot

## Matrix bot installation

See https://github.com/shayaantx/botdarr/wiki/Install-Matrix-Bot

## Jar installation/Configuration

1. Get latest copy of botdarr botdarr-release.jar
1. Make sure you have openjdk 8 or oracle java 8 installed on your machine
1. Make sure you run botdarr on the same type of OS has radarr, sonarr, and lidarr (or paths when adding content won't match target OS)
1. Create a folder called "database" in same folder you run jar in
1. Create a file called "properties" (without double quotes) in same folder as the jar
1. Fill it with the following properties (you can omit sonarr properties if you aren't using it, same with radarr/lidarr, however everything else listed below is required) - [See Sample properties](https://github.com/shayaantx/botdarr/blob/development/sample.properties)
1. You can only configure discord or slack or telegram token/channels, otherwise you will get an error during startup
1. There are is an available option for url base for both radarr/sonarr. If you have a url base and use radarr WITHOUT configuring the url base here, 
I've found radarr will execute most api requests normally, but /api/movie POST requests wont (assume this is a bug but haven't had time to investigate yet). 
Radarr seems to return a 200 http code, not actually add the movie, and return json as if you are calling /api/movie as a GET request, unless you prefix 
the api url with your radarr url base. So MAKE SURE you account for this in your config/setup.

1. Run the jar using java
```
nohup java -jar botdarr-release.jar &
```
<br/>

## Run with Docker

1. Docker images are here https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/shayaantx/botdarr/general
1. Create a folder on your host and replace <BOTDARR_HOME> with that folder
1. Make sure to fill in appropriate environment variables, [See Environment Variable Section](#environment-variable-configuration)
1. You will need to configure at least one chat client and at least one media api (i.e., radarr, sonarr, or lidarr)
1. Then run below command
```
# for latest
docker run -d --name botdarr -e DISCORD_TOKEN="blahblah" -e DISCORD_CHANNELS="channel1" -v <BOTDARR_HOME>/database:/home/botdarr/database -v <BOTDARR_HOME>/logs:/home/botdarr/logs shayaantx/botdarr:latest &
```

1. Or if you want to use docker-compose
1. If don't want to use environment variables to configure botdarr, mount a file named properties to ([See Sample properties](https://github.com/shayaantx/botdarr/blob/development/sample.properties)) to /home/botdarr/config

```

## Usage

* Type !help in your configured chat client to get information about commands and what is supported
* Notifications will appear indicating the current downloads (based on your configuration for max downloads), their status, and their time remaining.
* When you search for content (i.e., !movie title add History of Dumb People) if too many results are returned you will be presented with multiple results. You can either use the thumbs up reaction (in discord or slack) or copy the add command (which will be embedded in the result) into the chat client.
* Example commands:
  * !movie title add Lion Fling
  * !show title add One Fliece
  * !movie find new zombies
  * !artist find new Linkin Flarp
  * !movie downloads
  * !show downloads
  * !help
  * !shows help
  * !movies help
* The default command prefix is !. I chose ! because / (original command prefix) is commonly used by many chat clients and has existing functionality with it that leads to some commands not working nicely.
